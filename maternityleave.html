<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pocketlawyer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Maternity-Benefit-Bill-2016.pdf">Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill, 2016</a>&nbsp;comes into effect by April 1 2017. However, some provision (work from home) will be in effect from July 2017. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 aims at making the life of working mothers much easier which will benefit the whole society in direct and in direct way.</strong></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">What is Maternity Benefit?</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Maternity Benefit refers to the paid leave given to working women after giving birth. In most countries, maternity benefit is a legal obligation of the employer. These leave may be paid or unpaid. But in most cases, the law requires the leave to be paid. Maternity benefit, or &ldquo;maternity leave&rdquo;, can be anywhere between 6 weeks to 30 weeks in the world.</strong></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">What are the Major Changes?</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>The existing Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 grants female employees mandatory paid leave after giving birth. It also allows the mother to avail some part of maternity benefit before the actual delivery as well. The new Act adds some entirely new provisions at work places and also modifies the existing ones to be more helpful for pregnant and new mothers. Every establishment will be required to make these benefits available to the women from the time of her appointment. Below are some major changes in amendment:</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">&nbsp;Eligibility for maternity benefits</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Not much change in eligibility. Any women employee who worked in&nbsp;factory, mine, plantation, shop or any establishment which is having 10 or more employees, and she has actually worked there for a period of not less than eighty days in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery, is eligible for maternity leave. This applies either women recruited directly or through agency.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">&nbsp;Period of leave</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>The earlier act provided 12 weeks fully paid leave, while new act provides 26 weeks paid leave for first two children. Maternity leave for children after the first two will continue to be 12 weeks. Now, one can take 8 weeks before delivery while it was 6 weeks earlier.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Commissioning mothers and adopting mothers</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Both Adopting<sup>1</sup> as well as Commissioning<sup>2</sup> Mothers will get 12 weeks of Maternity Leave from the date of handing over of the child.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">&nbsp;Working from home</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>The earlier act did not have any provision for work from home, while the new act allows women to do work from home, if nature of work allow this.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">&nbsp;Cr&egrave;che facility</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>The amendment also has the provision of cr&egrave;che facility. It says that for every establishment with more than 50 employees provide cr&egrave;che facility for the working mother, so that they can take care of their kids while working. Although some more clarification needed here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Is it really very helpful?</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>This policy is really beneficial for the working women, who struggles between their new born and work. Reports also says that a women body require around 6 months to fully recover from delivery. As per the WHO recommendation, infants should be exclusively breastfed&nbsp;for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. So this is really a good step towards the working mother and kids. Though this will only benefit women working in organized sector not those who are working in the unorganized sector, and as per the study, in India around 90% of women works with unorganized sector. As long as a large percentage of India's manpower is in the unorganized sector, every benefit provided for the workforce will not reach to the vast majority. Other important point I would like to mention here, that the cost incurred will be bear by employer not the government, this may negatively affect the employment rate of fertile women in companies. Also this may have major impact on overall productivity of company, as it is added as a cost to company, but company not benefiting any work from these women employees. This will also impact overall growth and promotions for female employee. There may be the case that some women can misuse the policy, by extending these leaves to longer period.&nbsp; Also this act did not talk about paternity leave for men worker, this will add overall parental responsibility to mother only.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><sup>&nbsp;1 </sup></em><em>Adopting: Women who adopt a child below 3 months will be known as&nbsp;Adopting Mothers.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><sup>2 </sup></em><em>Commissioning: A woman having a baby through surrogacy will be known as the&nbsp;Commissioning Mother.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
